## Content

This repository includes

1. Instance data for the $p$-Hub Center Problem, which is origniated from the [Civil Aeronautic Board (CAB)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269396247_cab100_mok) dataset.
1. Raw results of our experiments including all the figures and tables.

### Data files

Instance data files are located in the folder [data](data), where [CAB.txt](data/CAB.txt) contains all the 100 locations in CAB dataset, out of which [CABCircle.csv](data/CABCircle.csv) contains 35 locations for experiments. 


### Results
The folder [results](results) contains the results of the experiments, each figure/table correponds to a folder.
